# Circles Mail Workaround
(app is named workaround_circles_mails because Nextcloud seems confused when the app name starts with "circle")

A small app fixing the annoying issue (since NC 27?) where the email subject and body state that "someone" shared a file when using circles for sharing.

## Installation
* install repository into your nextcloud/apps directory
* enable the app in the webinterface under /settings/apps
* enjoy!
